  traits: |
     * +2 Constitution, -2 Strength.
     * Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on _hide_ checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.
     * Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.
     * Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
     * Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.
     * +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.
     * Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects.
     * +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.
     * +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it's caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.
     * +2 racial bonus on _listen_ checks.
     * +2 racial bonus on _craft (alchemy)_ checks.
     * Automatic Languages: Common and Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Orc. In addition, a gnome can speak with a burrowing mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit, or the like, see below). This ability is innate to gnomes. See the _speak with animals_ spell description.
     * Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day&ndash;_speak with animals_ (burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day&ndash;_dancing lights_, _ghost sound_, _prestidigitation_. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome's Cha modifier + spell level.
     * Favored Class: Bard. A multiclass gnome's bard class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.
