  description:        |
    This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path.

    A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled {% die_roll 1 4 0 %}x10 feet, taking {% die_roll 1 4 0 %} points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back {% die_roll 2 6 0 %}x10 feet and takes {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.

    Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back {% die_roll 1 6 0 %}x10 feet.

    Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back {% die_roll 1 6 0 %}x5 feet.

    Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect.

    A gust of wind can't move a creature beyond the limit of its range.

    Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a gust of wind.

    The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.

    In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

    Gust of wind can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
