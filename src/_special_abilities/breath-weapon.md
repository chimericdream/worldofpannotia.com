title: "Breath Weapon"

ability:
  types: ["Su"]
  description: |
    A creature attacking with a breath weapon is actually expelling something from its mouth (rather than conjuring it by means of a spell or some other magical effect). Most creatures with breath weapons are limited to a number of uses per day or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures are usually smart enough to save their breath weapon until they really need it.

    A breath weapon attack usually deals damage and is often based on some type of energy.

    Such breath weapons allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + &#189; breathing creature's racial HD + breathing creature's Con modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text). A creature is immune to its own breath weapon unless otherwise noted. Some breath weapons allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a Reflex save.

     * Using a breath weapon is typically a standard action.
     * No attack roll is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.
     * Any character caught in the area must make the appropriate saving throw or suffer the breath weapon's full effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds on his saving throw still takes half damage or some other reduced effect.
     * Breath weapons are supernatural abilities except where noted.
     * Creatures are immune to their own breath weapons.
     * Creatures unable to breathe can still use breath weapons. (The term is something of a misnomer.)
