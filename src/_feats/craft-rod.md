title: "Craft Rod"

feat:
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  prerequisite: |
    Caster level 9th.
  benefit: |
    You can create any rod whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a rod takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a rod, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price.

    Some rods incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the rod's base price.
