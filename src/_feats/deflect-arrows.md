title: "Deflect Arrows"

feat:
  types: ["General", "Fighter"]
  prerequisite: |
    Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.
  benefit: |
    You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flatfooted.

    Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons and ranged attacks generated by spell effects can't be deflected.
  special: |
    A monk may select Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat at 2nd level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

    A fighter may select Deflect Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.
