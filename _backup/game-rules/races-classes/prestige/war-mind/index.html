    <h4>Class Features</h4>
    All the following are class features of the war mind prestige class.
    **Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** War minds gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
    **Power Points/Day:** A war mind can manifest powers. His ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The War Mind. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score. His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items. If a war mind has power points from a different class, those points are pooled together and usable to manifest powers from either class. Bonus power points from having a high ability score can be gained only for the character's highest psionic class.
    **Powers Known:** A war mind chooses his powers from the psychic warrior power list. At 1st level, a war mind knows one psychic warrior power of your choice. At every even-numbered level higher than 1st, he learns one new power. A war mind can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level. The total number of powers a war mind can manifest per day is limited only by his daily power points.
    A war mind simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.
    The Difficulty Class for saving throws against war mind powers is 10 + the power's level + the war mind's Wisdom modifier.
    **Maximum Power Level Known: **A war mind gains the ability to learn one 1st-level power when he takes his first level in the prestige class. As he attains each even-numbered level beyond 2nd, a war mind gains the ability to master more complex powers.
    To learn or manifest a power, a war mind must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.
    **Chain of Personal Superiority (Ex):** At 1st level, a war mind learns the first principle of warfare for the individual combatant: the ability to both deal punishment and take it. Calling upon inner reserves of knowledge and dedication, a war mind can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Strength and Constitution for up to 1 minute. A war mind can use this power three times per day. Activating this power is a free action. At 7th level, the insight bonus to Strength and Constitution improves to +4.
    **Chain of Defensive Posture (Ex):** At 2nd level, a war mind learns the second principle of warfare for the individual combatant: the ability to avoid the enemy's counterattacks if that enemy is not immediately overwhelmed. Calling upon inner reserves of knowledge and dedication, a war mind can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class for up to 1 minute. A war mind can use this power three times per day. Activating this power is a free action. At 8th level, the insight bonus to Armor Class improves to +4.
    **Enduring Body (Ex):** At 3rd level, a war mind learns the third principle of warfare for the individual combatant: to unleash in oneself the spirit of the enduring body. The spirit of the ideal body transforms a war mind, granting him damage reduction 1/&ndash;. At 6th level, his damage reduction improves to 2/&ndash;. At 9th level, his damage reduction improves to 3/&ndash;.
    **Sweeping Strike (Ex):** At 5th level, a war mind gains the ability to make great, sweeping swings with a melee weapon. On each melee attack a war mind makes, he can choose squares he threatens that are adjacent to each other, and his attacks apply to creatures in those two squares equally. A war mind can use this ability on any attack, even an attack of opportunity or a cleave attempt.
    A war mind cannot use this ability if he has moved more than 10 feet since the end of his last turn. If a war mind drops one or both of his foes with a sweeping strike, he can attempt a cleave normally; however, he makes only one cleave attempt per sweeping strike, even if he drops more than one foe.
    **Chain of Overwhelming Force (Su):** At 10th level, a war mind learns the fourth principle of warfare for the individual combatant: to discover the underlying violence of the world and deliver it in a perfectly executed attack.
    The war mind taps into this underlying energy and apply it to a single attack, dealing an extra 10d6 points of damage. A war mind can use this power once per day. Activating this power is a free action. If the attack misses, the power is wasted.
