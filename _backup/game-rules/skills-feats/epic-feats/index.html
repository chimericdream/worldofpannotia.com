<h3 id="acquiring-feats">Acquiring Epic Feats</h3>
Characters gain epic feats in the following ways:
At 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, the character may select an epic feat in place of a nonepic feat.
Each character class gains bonus epic feats according to the class description. These feats must be selected from the list of bonus epic feats for that class.

<h4 id="prereqs">Prerequisites</h4>
Most epic feats have prerequisites. A character must have the listed ability score, feat, skill, class feature, or base attack modifier in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain an epic feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite, just as with regular feats. A prerequisite expressed as a numerical value is a minimum; any value higher than the one given also meets the prerequisite. A character can't use an epic feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.
<h4 id="types">Types of Epic Feats</h4>
Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others may be item creation feats or metamagic feats, which follow all the normal rules for such feats, except as specified in the feat's description. In addition, some feats are defined as divine feats or as wild feats. Such feats are described below.
<h4 id="divine-feats">Divine Feats</h4>
The feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all have as a prerequisite the ability to turn (or, in most cases, rebuke) undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or higher, and any prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to turn other creatures does not qualify a character to select one of these feats.) Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use of a divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt from his or her number of attempts each day. If a character doesn't have any turn/rebuke attempts left, he or she can't use the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action, activating any of these feats is also a standard action.
<h4 id="wild-feats">Wild Feats</h4>
The feats in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability to use _wild shape_ as a druid. These feats require the character to have the ability to use _wild shape_ before acquiring the feat.
<h4 id="psionic-feats">Epic Psionic Feats</h4>
Psionic characters can acquire epic "psionically flavored" feats. Some feats require so much translation that converted feats are provided. Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion, some translation must be done to use it with psionics. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward as changing a few names. Translating epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats requires that _spellcraft_ prerequisites be replaced with _psicraft_. It also requires a little math&ndash;instead of casting a spell at a higher level, a psionic character pays more power points. For every spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level the metamagic feat requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character to pay a power point cost equal to its standard cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows a spellcaster to "pay" one less level to use a metamagic feat, the psionic version allows a character to pay 2 power points less for a given metapsionic feat.

    **Benefit:** As a standard action, the character can make one melee attack for every five points of his or her base attack bonus (including epic attack bonus, round fractions down).
    The character cannot attack any one opponent more than once as part of this action. These attacks (as well as all other attacks made until the start of the character's next turn) suffer a -4 penalty.
    When using the Improved Whirlwind feat, the character also forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other spells or abilities (such as Cleave or the haste spell).
    Since these attacks are made as part of a standard action the character can't make a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.
    **Normal:** Without this feat, using the Whirlwind Attack feat requires a full attack action, and the character can take a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.

    Prerequisites: Cha 25, greater rage class feature.

The ally gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a -2 penalty to AC, for as long as the character remains raging. The rage of affected allies lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier, regardless of whether they remain within 60 feet of the character. This is otherwise identical with normal barbarian rage (including the fatigue at its end).
    **Special:** This is a mind-affecting effect.
</div>

<div id="infinite-deflection" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Infinite Deflection [Epic]</h4>

    **Benefit:** The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to one ability score to his or her allies. To be affected, an ally must hear the bard sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the bard sings and for 5 rounds after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bard). While singing, the bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence bonus to the same ability score, which the character must choose before he or she begins inspiring. Inspire excellence is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability. Use of this feat counts as one of the character's bardic music uses for the day.
    **Special:** This feat is treated as a bardic music inspiration ability for purposes of feats that affect such abilities.

    **Prerequisites:** Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, _spellcraft_ 30 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.
    **Benefit:** All variable, numeric effects of an intensified spell are maximized, then doubled. An intensified spell deals twice maximum damage, cures twice the maximum number of hit points, affects twice the maximum number of targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. An intensified spell uses up a spell slot seven levels higher than the spell's actual level. A character can't combine the effects of this feat with any other feat that affects the variable, numeric effects of a spell.
</div>

<div id="keen-strike" class="sf-box">

    **Benefit:** The character's unarmed strike has a critical threat range of 18-20 and deals slashing damage (at the character's option any attack can deal bludgeoning damage, but cannot then take advantage of the enhanced threat range).

</div>

<div id="lasting-inspiration" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Lasting Inspiration [Epic]</h4>
    **Prerequisite:** _perform_ 25 ranks, bardic music class feature.
