title: "Wingover"
slug: "wingover"

feat:
  name: "Wingover"
  types: ["General"]
  prerequisite: |
    Fly speed.
  benefit: |
    A flying creature with this feat can change direction quickly once each round as a free action. This feat allows it to turn up to 180 degrees regardless of its maneuverability, in addition to any other turns it is normally allowed. A creature cannot gain altitude during a round when it executes a wingover, but it can dive.

    The change of direction consumes 10 feet of flying movement.
