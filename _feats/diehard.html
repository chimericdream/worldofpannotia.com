title: "Diehard"
slug: "diehard"

feat:
  name: "Diehard"
  types: ["General"]
  prerequisite: |
    Endurance.
  benefit: |
    When reduced to negative hit points, you automatically become stable. You don't have to roll d% to see if you lose 1 hit point each round.

    When reduced to negative hit points, you may choose to act as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn't your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.

    When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard action each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full round action. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some free actions, swift actions, or immediate actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If your hit points reaches your <a href="">negative hit point threshold</a>, you immediately die.
  normal: |
    A character without this feat who is reduced to negative hit points is unconscious and dying.
